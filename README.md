# Advanced Data Analytics Course 

In this repository, I include assignments and smaller projects I made for my Advanced Data Anlytics Course at Queen's University. Each assignment evalauates the design and implementation of complex analytic techniques such as predictive algorithms at scale, deep learning, clustering at scale, advance matrix decomposition, analytics in the web, collaborative filtering (social network analysis, social network analysis, and application in soecialized domains. 

Here I will give a brief overview of each excercise/assignment posted as a jupyter notebook file.

Exercise 1: My first data analytics project ever! The goal of this excercise is to understand the data exploration process. I perform three types of statistical summaries, perform a one way anova statistical test, and a correlation analysis. The provided dataset is a csv file containing airbnb listing in Montreal.

Exercise 2: The goal of this exercise is to create bagging and boosting models, as well as to learn how to split data into training and testing sets. In addition, I tune the hyper-parameters of the model reacts. The data provided is a public dataset containing employee profiles of a large company. 

Exercise 3: The goal of this assignment is to analyze textual data. The dataset provided is a table containing questions about R on StackOverflow site. Here I use existing libraries such as gensim to learn word embeddings, and perform topic analysis.
